:description: Pirus may be installed in several ways, choose your favorite.


[role="lead"]
Pirus is an executable that you'll run from the command line
to build your PEAR Channel server with your custom skin for the web interface.
Before you begin, ensure that you have at least
link:http://www.php.net[PHP] 5.2.1 installed.

== PEAR _recommanded_

First you will need to install two dependencies :

* PEAR http://pear.php.net/package/Console_CommandLine[Console_CommandLine] 1.1.3 minimum
* http://pear.pirum-project.org/[Pirum] 1.0.5 minimum

[caption="Caution", name="warning"]
NOTE: *Pirum 1.1.4 is not PHP 5.2 compatible*

[source,diff]
----
$ pear channel-discover pear.pirum-project.org
$ pear install pirum/pirum
$ pear install console_commandline
----

Then you can install Pirus itself.

[source,diff]
----
$ pear channel-discover bartlett.laurent-laville.org
$ pear install bartlett/Pirus
----

You can now execute Pirus simply by running the [label label-inverse]#pirus# command:

----

== Git

You can also clone the project.

[source,diff]
----
$ git clone git://github.com/llaville/Pirus.git && cd Pirus
----

Copy the `Pirus` sub-folder in a `Bartlett` directory
accessible by your `include_path`.

.When [label]#include_path# is equals to [label]#.:/php/includes#
====
[source,diff]
----
$ mkdir /php/includes/Bartlett && cp Pirus/* /php/includes/Bartlett
----
====

[caption="Warning", name="warning"]
NOTE: Don't forget to install also the two dependencies `Console_CommandLine`
and `Pirum`. See PEAR method.

Check that Pirus works. Run the local [label label-inverse]#pirus# command.
[source,diff]
----
$ php scripts/pirus -v
----
That should give expected result:
====
pirus version DEV.
====

== Phar

[caption="Info", name="info"]
NOTE: Since version 1.2.0, Pirus provides a Phar package version that didn't required any installation.
Even for dependencies used.

Simply download the phar archive at http://barlett.laurent-laville.org/get/pirus.phar[]

And follow instruction, as usual, by running the command:

[source,diff]
----
$ php pirus.phar
----
