:description: Overview of the project, its contents, and how to get started with your own template.

== Installation

[role="lead"]
Head to the link:./INSTALL.html[Install Guide] if it's your first run with Pirus.

Choose your favorite way between PEAR, GIT, and PHAR.

== What is included

[role="lead"]
Pirus comes with the default template of Pirum, HTML and CSS code on separate files,
and all its basic features.

`build`::   Build the full content of the target directory.
`add`::     Add a new package release.
`remove`::  Remove a single old release.

== Global options

[role="lead"]
If you always build a PEAR Channel with Pirum and the same skin,
it is recommended to write your templates directory and the theme name,
into a INI configuration file.

If you have installed Pirus with PEAR, a template of this INI file `pirus.ini.dist`
is available on the `@cfg_dir@/Pirus` directory.

[caption="Info", name="info"]
NOTE: Run the [label label-inverse]#pear config-get cfg_dir# command to know where is located
your `@cfg_dir@` directory.

Here is the content of default INI configuration file: `@cfg_dir@/Pirus/pirus.ini.dist`

[source,ini]
----
[templates]
dir=/path/to/your/data/Pirus/templates
theme=default
----

Make your changes, and save a copy on `@cfg_dir@/Pirus/pirus.ini`.

* `dir` entry is equivalent to Pirus either short option [label]#-d#, or long option [label]#--templatesDir#.
* `theme` entry is equivalent to Pirus either short option [label]#-t#, or long option [label]#--theme#.

== Local options

[role="lead"]

than your favorite, then use the short or long options of the Pirus command.
