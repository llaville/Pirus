[role="lead"]
This simple tutorial will demonstrate how to manage your pirum server with your own template.


== What is included

[role="lead"]
Pirus comes with the same features as Pirum, which is almost the same code.
Pirus add ability to handle your own templates easily, with a sample configuration file.

This configuration file is named `pirum.ini` (for windows users), and `.pirumrc` (for linux users).

Don't be confused, between the two names Pirum and Pirus.
Pirus 2.0 is only the behavior missing to Pirum 1.x

It's the same interface, commands, as Pirum. After all it's not a surprise,
because Pirus 2 is a forked code of Pirum 1.1.5-dev


== Structure of Configuration File

[role="lead"]
To handle multiple server and different graphical theme, it's a pain and a maelstrom to do it with Pirum.
You have to switch from a copy of your `templates/` directory to another.

With Pirus 2.0 and a simple INI file, that should exist in the same directory as
the pirus script itself, like that :

[source,ini]
----
[pirum]
template = default
templatedir = templates

;[/path/to/your/pear/channel/server]
;template = subfolder_of_templatedir
;templatedir = /path/to/your/templates
----
You have the same behavior as Pirum 1.1.4

This INI file is only a list of section, where each one define a single server
and it's location (on your file system), and the theme (template) to apply.


== Migrate from Pirum to Pirus

[role="lead"]
Only two easy steps are required.

* *First*, write a simple INI content file like the one below
and named it following the platform rules : `pirum.ini` (for windows users),
and `.pirumrc` (for linux users). It must be located in the same directory
as pirus executable.

* *Second*, just use [label label-inverse]#pirus# command rather than [label label-inverse]#pirum#

.Default Configuration File Pattern
[source,ini]
----
[pirum]
template = default
templatedir = templates
----


== Add your first template

[role="lead"]
As Pirum, to get you started, you can copy and paste the default templates
found in the `buildIndex()` and `buildCss()` methods. Or just copy the default theme
in the `templates/default` directory of Pirus.

Suppose your PEAR Channel Server is locate in `/var/pirum/servers/mypearchannel`,
you've named it _mypearchannel_ and you named the theme _lightgreen_.

Your configuration file should look like this one :

[source,ini]
----
[pirum]
template = default
templatedir = templates

[/var/pirum/servers/mypearchannel]
template = lightgreen
----

In summary, your new file system structure will be :

====
----
  +-- pirus
  +-- templates/
      +-- default/        <1>
      |   +-- index.html
      |   +-- pirum.css
      +-- lightgreen/     <2>
          +-- index.html
          +-- pirum.css
----
====
<1> The default theme of Pirum
<2> You own templates html and stylesheet


== Advanced usage

[role="lead"]
If you want to separate location of your different themes and servers, you can
use another `templatedir` directive to do so.

Split templates directory in two groups : distribution files and your own files

[source,ini]
----
[pirum]
template = 
templatedir = templates

[/var/pirum/servers/myfirstpearchannel]
template = lightgreen
templatedir = /var/pirum/templates

[/var/pirum/servers/mysecondpearchannel]
template = ocean
templatedir = /var/pirum/templates
----

Your file system will look like :
====
----
  /usr/local/php/pear/
    +-- pirus
        +-- templates/        <1>
            +-- index.html
            +-- pirum.css

  /var/pirum/templates/
    +-- lightgreen/           <2>
    |   +-- index.html
    |   +-- pirum.css
    +-- ocean/                <3>
        +-- index.html
        +-- pirum.css
----
====
<1> The default theme of Pirum
<2> _lightgreen_ theme for your PEAR Channel Server
<3> _ocean_ theme for your PEAR Channel Server


== Examples

The PEAR Bartlett Channel is the first one that use Pirus.

`bartlett` template is based on the Pirum `default` template.
